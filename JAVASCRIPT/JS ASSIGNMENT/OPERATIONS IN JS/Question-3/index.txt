Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
Answer:

1. Unary Operators: Unary operators operate on a single operand. They      perform operations like incrementing, negating, or converting values.

  Example 1: Increment Operator (`++`)
   
     let x = 5;
     x++; // x is now 6
    

   Example 2: Negation Operator (`-`)
    
     let y = 10;
     y = -y; // y is now -10
    

   -Example 3: Logical NOT Operator (`!`)
    
     let isTrue = true;
     isTrue = !isTrue; // isTrue is now false
    

2. Binary Operators: Binary operators require two operands. They are used for operations like addition, subtraction, and comparisons.

   Example 1: Addition Operator (`+`)
    
     let a = 10;
     let b = 5;
     let sum = a + b; // sum is 15
     

   Example 2: Subtraction Operator (`-`)
    
     let x = 20;
     let y = 8;
     let difference = x - y; // difference is 12
  

   Example 3: Equality Operator (`==`)
    
     let a = 5;
     let b = 10;
     let isEqual = (a == b); // isEqual is false
    

3. Ternary Operators: The ternary operator is a shorthand for the if-else statement and requires three operands. The syntax is condition ? expression1 : expression2. If the condition is true, expression1 is evaluated; otherwise, expression2 is evaluated.

   Example 1: Basic Usage
    
     let age = 18;
     let message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor"; // message is "Adult"
    

   Example 2: Nested Ternary Operators
    
     let score = 85;
     let result = (score >= 90) ? "Excellent" :
                  (score >= 70) ? "Good" :
                  "Needs Improvement"; // result is "Good"
