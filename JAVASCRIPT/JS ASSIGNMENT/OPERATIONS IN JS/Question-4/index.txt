Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Answer:
Operator Precedence

What It Is: Determines which operators are evaluated first.
Example: In `5 + 3 * 2`, `*` is evaluated before `+`, so the result is `11` (not `16`).

Operator Associativity

What It Is: Defines the order operators of the same precedence are evaluated.
Left-to-Right: Most operators (e.g., `+`, `-`).
Example: `10 - 5 + 2` evaluates as `(10 - 5) + 2`.

Right-to-Left: Some operators (e.g., `**`, `=`)
Example: `2 ** 3 ** 2` evaluates as `2 ** (3 ** 2)`.

Why It Matters?

Predict Results: Helps us to know how expressions will be evaluated.
Avoid Errors: Prevents unexpected results and bugs.
Improve Readability: Makes code easier to understand.
