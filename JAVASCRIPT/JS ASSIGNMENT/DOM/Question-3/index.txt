Q3. Explain the concept of Event Bubbling in the DOM.

Answer.
Event bubbling is when an event (like a click) starts at the specific element where it happened and then moves up through its parent elements in the DOM.

For example, if we click a button inside a <div>, the event first triggers on the button, then on the <div>, and so on up to the root.

Itâ€™s useful for things like event delegation, where we can manage events on multiple child elements by attaching a single listener to the parent. we can stop bubbling with event.stopPropagation() if needed.
