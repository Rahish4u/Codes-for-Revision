Q-1.
Explain the DOM and its role in Web development.

Answer:
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML document as a tree structure, where each element, attribute, and text is a node. It allows JavaScript to access and modify the content, structure, and styles of a webpage.

In web development, the DOM is crucial because it:

-- Enables dynamic updates to content without reloading the page.
-- Handles user interactions through events (e.g., clicks, inputs).
-- Lets developers change HTML/CSS in real-time, making web pages interactive and responsive.
