                    Artificial Intelligence is emerging as the go-to technology across
                    industries, and nobody wants to be left behind. Tech giant Google
                    has partnered with Apollo Radiology International to use the
                    transformative power of AI in healthcare. Ahead of the highly
                    anticipated <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> Health Global Check
                    Up event, <a href="www.indianexpress.com">indianexpress.com</a> got
                    in touch with Dr Sreenivasa Raju Kalidindi, CEO and Medical Director
                    of Apollo Radiology International, and Shravya Shetty, Director &
                    Engineering Lead at Google Health AI Research. In a wide-ranging
                    conversation, the duo offered some profound insights into the
                    significance of AI in healthcare, along with the potential of AI to
                    fill gaps in terms of access and expertise.

                    You’ve heard about AI image generators like Dall-E that can whip up
                    photorealistic pics from simple text prompts. Well, now there’s an
                    AI called Suno (yes, it’s the Hindi word) that can compose entirely
                    original music tracks complete with vocals and lyrics, just by
                    describing the vibe you’re going for. I spent some time jamming with
                    Suno’s web app, and I have to say, the results are impressive in
                    their realism, if a bit uncanny. Simply type in a prompt like “an
                    electronic song with heavy bass about AI taking over the world” and
                    within seconds, Suno will serve up a couple of fully-formed
                    ~45-second tracks.

                    Ever since Virat Kohli returned to India, even the minutest detail
                    about the 35-year-old has found its way to social media. That he
                    spotted a salt-and-pepper beard when he arrived at the Bangalore
                    Airport; that he wore baggy black t-shirts, or he lunged to his left
                    and then sprung to his right during a fielding drill. Suddenly, the
                    narrative that Kohli needs a profitable IPL to guarantee his spot in
                    the T20 World Cup, which begins a week after the league, has
                    vanished.

                    The IPL 2024 season is set to begin on March 22, Friday with
                    defending champions Chennai Super Kings taking on Royal Challengers
                    Bangalore at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. While all 10
                    teams are hitting their final lap of preparations ahead of the
                    tournament, a slew of injuries and other concerns have led to
                    multiple players being ruled out of the 17th edition.

                    Even as inflation is easing, the repetitive incidence of short
                    amplitude food price pressures deters a swifter fall in headline

                    the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monthly bulletin said. The
                    monetary policy needs to guide <a href="#">inflation</a> to the 4 per cent target
                    while ensuring that the momentum of growth is sustained, it said. As
                    per an in-house model, the GDP growth is likely to remain robust at
                    7.4 per cent during FY25, the article said. This estimate is higher
                    than the RBI’s projection of the real GDP growth for 2024-25 at 7
                    per cent.

                    Spotify’s fourth annual report, which originally launched in 2021 following criticism over its lack of transparency, noted record accomplishments, including the highest annual payment from any retailer to the music industry.
