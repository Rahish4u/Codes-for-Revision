Q4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML

Answer:
1. Use Semantic HTML: Utilize appropriate tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to define the structure and meaning of content.

2. Provide Alternative Text: Include `alt` attributes for images to describe their content for screen readers.

3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility: Make all interactive elements, like buttons and links, usable via keyboard navigation.
