Q5. What is DOCTYPE declaration in html? 

Answer:
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is an instruction to the web browser about the version of HTML that the page is written in. It helps the browser render the content correctly.

Purpose
*Specifies HTML Version*: It specifies the version of HTML being used, which can affect how the browser interprets the page's code.

*Ensures Standards Mode*: It triggers standards mode in browsers, ensuring that the page is rendered according to modern web standards rather than in "quirks mode," which emulates older browser behaviors.

it`s look like this

<!DOCTYPE html>
