Q4. Write a short note on a Tag and element with an example?

Answer:

Tag
A tag in HTML is a part of the HTML syntax used to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and often come in pairs: an opening tag (<tagname>) and a closing tag (</tagname>). Some tags are self-closing.

Example of a tag:
<p> is an opening tag for a paragraph.
</p> is a closing tag for a paragraph.

Element
An element in HTML is a complete unit that includes the opening tag, content, and closing tag. It defines the structure and content of a webpage.

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
